{"name":"Responsive Thumbnail Carousel","tagline":"All flexible and stuff","body":"Responsive-Thumbnail-Carousel\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n<p>This is a basic jQuery-powered carousel. There are many like it, but this is mine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some things I like about it:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Minimal HTML\r\n<li>Graceful <code>overflow: auto</code> fallback for non-JS users\r\n<li>CSS transitions for animations (uses Modernizr to serve jQuery animation fallback to non-transitioning browsers)\r\n<li>Supports multiple carousels\r\n<li>Supports carousels of any width, percentage or fixed\r\n<li>Supports any number of items within the carousel\r\n<li>Recalculates controls on window resize\r\n<li>Makes the controls visible at all times for touch devices (again using Modernizr)\r\n<li>If the controls aren't needed they don't appear at all\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Things I don't like about it:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Thumbnails within a carousel must be consistent widths\r\n<li>The JS is pretty unsophisticated â€” it could be made more elegant\r\n<li>It fails in IE8, but I haven't looked into why yet\r\n<li>There seems to be a minor error in the control logic, but I haven't been able to nail it down\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Other stuff to know:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I haven't done any optimizing for smaller screens\r\n<li>I've included <a href=\"https://github.com/mathiasbynens\">@mathias</a>' <a href=\"https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-noselect\">noSelect</a> jQuery plugin to prevent annoying cursor/selection behavior while interacting with the controls; you might want to remove this depending on the content of your thumbnails\r\n</ul>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
